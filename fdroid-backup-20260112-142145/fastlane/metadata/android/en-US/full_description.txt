🛡️ GuardianOS – Ethical digital protection for minors

Did you know WhatsApp stores unencrypted backups? That Instagram accesses your calls and contacts?

GuardianOS is a free and open-source tool that audits your Android device **without sending any data to the internet**. It detects:

• Apps with spyware or ransomware behavior  
• Dangerous permissions (microphone, location, contacts)  
• Hidden trackers and known malware signatures  
• Insecure system configurations  

✨ Features:
- 100% offline audit  
- Detailed PDF report  
- Focus on child protection  
- Open-source and transparent  
- No ads, no tracking  

🔒 All analysis happens locally. No personal data or app info is sent to external servers.
